Computer science student living in Lafayette, IN. I am currently in the PhD program at Purdue University but am planning on leaving early with a master's degree. Looking for a full time position after I graduate in May 2023.

I was most recently employed as a software developer at [Holos, Inc](https://holos.io/). My primary interests are in programming languages, computer graphics and machine learning.

In the past I was at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the position of Assistant Staff. While there I primarily focused on embedded systems development, computer networking and graph theory research. I left this position in early 2019.

**Areas of Expertise**: Programming Languages, Computer Networking, Computer Graphics, Embedded Systems Programming, Machine Learning, Concurrent Systems, Simulation and Game Development, and Mathematics
