Software developer/researcher living in Madison, WI. I was most recently employed as a software developer at [Holos, Inc](https://holos.io/). My primary interests are in programming languages, computer graphics and machine learning.

In the past I was at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the position of Assistant Staff. While there I primarily focused on embedded systems development, computer networking and graph theory research. I left this position in early 2019.

I will be starting as a PhD student at Purdue University this fall (2021), where I will be doing research with [Roopsha Samanta](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/roopsha/).

**Areas of Expertise**: Programming Language Theory, Computer Graphics, Embedded Systems Programming, Concurrent Systems, Graph Theory, Computational Geometry, Simulation and Game Development, Mathematics
