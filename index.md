Computer scientist living in Cambridge, MA. I hold a MS in Computer Science from Purdue University and a BS in Computer Science from Tufts University. I currently am a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at [Draper Laboratory](https://www.draper.com/), primarily focused on binary software analysis. At this role I was a key innovator for Draper's contribution to the [DARPA Assured Micropatching (AMP) Project](https://www.darpa.mil/program/assured-micropatching). I am now working on a new project in software analysis for one of Draper's customers.

From 2019-2022 I was a software engineer at [Holos](https://holos.io/), a VR startup based in Madison, WI. I was brought on to take Holos' single player VR experience and make it work across networked connections. Holos' software is used for training purposes, and was developed under a contract from the US Air Force to train F-35 fighter jet mechanics.

In the past I was at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/) in the position of Assistant Staff. While there I primarily focused on embedded systems development, computer networking and graph theory research. I left this position in early 2019.

**Areas of Expertise**: Programming Languages, Computer Networking, Software Security, Computer Graphics, Embedded Systems Programming, Machine Learning, Concurrent Systems, Simulation and Game Development, and Mathematics

[Blockspell - a multiplayer magical combat game set in a voxel environment](http://www.blockspell.com/). Development has been permanently suspended due to changing priorities

Ace of Spades, pyspades server developer. Game acquired by [Jagex Game Studios](https://www.jagex.com/) and subsequently [released on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/224540/Ace_of_Spades_Battle_Builder/). The original game can still be played for free at [Build and Shoot](https://www.buildandshoot.com/), although player counts have dwindled in recent years.

### Fun Links

- [Wikipedia Current Events Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events). My goto site for mostly unbiased coverage of current world news. I often find things here that aren't being covered in mainstream American media. One of the true gems of the Internet.
- [Georgism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism). An interesting economic alternative to both the current American capitalism system and socialism/communism. [Has features that are desirable to both liberals and libertarians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smi_iIoKybg).
- If you have never seen a unicycle freestyle performance, I recommend checking it out! Freestyle unicycle performances are very similar to figure skating routines, where the performers do tricks in sync with music. The Japanese team is excellent, I recommend their videos: [Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smi_iIoKybg), [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp5mDJMxLMQ).
- [Interaction Nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_nets) are an evaluation strategy that allows for easy parallel computation of lambda calculus. It is a confluent graph rewrite system where any particular reduction path is beta-optimal. The logic for each worker thread is quite simple since it is easy to discover redexes by looking for active pairs of nodes.
