Computer scientist living in Cambridge, MA. I just graduated with my Master's degree from Purdue University and will be joining Draper Laboratory as a Senior Member of the Technical Staff in the formal methods group.

In the past I was at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the position of Assistant Staff. While there I primarily focused on embedded systems development, computer networking and graph theory research. I left this position in early 2019.

**Areas of Expertise**: Programming Languages, Computer Networking, Computer Graphics, Embedded Systems Programming, Machine Learning, Concurrent Systems, Simulation and Game Development, and Mathematics

### Current Projects

[Juniper - Functional Reactive Programming for the Arduino](http://www.juniper-lang.org/)

[dihash - Python library for hashing directed graphs](https://pypi.org/project/dihash/)

### Past Projects

[Blockspell - a multiplayer magical combat game set in a voxel environment](http://www.blockspell.com/). Development has been more or less permanently suspended due to high development costs.

Ace of Spades, pyspades server developer. Game acquired by [Jagex Game Studios](https://www.jagex.com/) and subsequently [released on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/224540/Ace_of_Spades_Battle_Builder/). The original game can still be played for free at [Build and Shoot](https://www.buildandshoot.com/), although player counts have dwindled in recent years.

### Global Game Jam Projects

[Cell Tower Tycoon - 2018](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/cell-tower-tycoon)

[Wave Rider - 2017](https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/wave-rider-3)
